		Manifestos are hard. They're also very cheesy. Are people really inspired by various sentences with different sizes? Here's how I really feel about being a Millennial in a manifesto form. 
		
		When someone knocks on the door, do you really have to answer? No. Living with your parents, not actually as embarrassing as it used to be. Who could say no to a rent-free basement and a fully stocked fridge? Marriage? That can wait too. Where's the fire? Better check your pocket, it might be your Samsung Galaxy Note 7! Did someone say Amazon Prime? Now you'll never, "cash me outside, howbow dat." Did you find this mildly entertaining? There's plenty more where this came from.
