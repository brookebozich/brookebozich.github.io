					Manifestos are cheesy. Are people really inspired by various sentences in different fonts and sizes? With that being said, I only did it for the alliteration. So if you have't already stopped reading, here's the point: Millennialas--Are we the best or the worst?

					When someone knocks on the door, do you really have to answer? No--especially when it's your parent's house. Why buy a house when you can live in one for free? Our Baby Boomer parents are basically just our best friends, who also gave birth to us. I can't think of a more ideal combination. Speaking of mariage--That can wait too. Where's the fire? (Better check your pocket, it might be your Samsung Galaxy Note 7).  
					</p>
					<p>
					But also who's really purchasing a Samsung Galaxy Note 7? Everyone knows that androids are for poor people. Anyway, after a long day of Instagram scrolling, Facebook lurking and Subtweeting, you had probably just finished group messaging all 3 of your friends. All of you were feeling really social, but none of you wanted to get off your couch. So you sent each other rapid fire Snapchats instead. Speaking of never leaving your home, did someone say Amazon Prime? Now you'll never, "cash me outside, howbow dat."
